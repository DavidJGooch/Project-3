Ethical considerations
We initially tried to find a topic that would show how positive EV's are for the environment. However after going through a few different data sets we setteled on one that highlighted specific types of vehicles registered in each zipcode of the state of Washington. Ethically we need to make sure that we didn't use any personal identifiers for the data, for example if we had access to a dataset that had peoples names on it. Secondly, we needed a data set that was big enough to give a picture of how EV's have grown over time, but also not highlighting sensitive information and keeping it as broad as possible. Finally we put together different charts individually using different data points to create different tables and charts to highlight the growth of EV registrations over time.
