Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilashrafi/elecrict-vehicle

Contributions:

Robert Crozier:  "Electric Vehicle Counts by Make as of 2023" and "Make Vs Model Year(2019)"

Clayton Stewart: "Car Make And Model Distribution"

David Gooch: Interactive "Washington State Electric Vehicle Range by Model Through The Years" scatter and line chart

Wilnelia Aviles: "Top 10 Count of Cars per City", "Top 10 Make distribution count per top 10 County", "total_model_count"

David Cortez: "Electric & Fuel Vehicle Population"



Ethical Considerations:

We initially tried to find a topic that would show how positive EV's are for the environment. However after going through a few different data sets we setteled on one that highlighted specific types of vehicles registered in each zipcode of the state of Washington. Ethically we need to make sure that we didn't use any personal identifiers for the data, for example if we had access to a dataset that had peoples names on it. Secondly, we needed a data set that was big enough to give a picture of how EV's have grown over time, but also not highlighting sensitive information and keeping it as broad as possible. Finally we put together different charts individually using different data points to create different tables and charts to highlight the growth of EV registrations over time.  



How to interact with the project (Instruction Manual): 

Upon opening the webpage.html with "Open with Live Server", you will be brought to the html page showing the different demonstrations of our dataset "Electric Vehicle Population Data
Washington State Electric Vehicle Demographic Data" done with different visualizations.  The interactive visualizations first involve the pie chart at the top titled "Car Make And Model Distribution".  To interact with the chart, you can click on a selection of years with the dropdown menu directly above it.  Then as you hover above the pie chart, you will see summarizations of each piech of the pie.  If you click on different make/models in the legend to the right, it will eliminate the selection and show how the chart looks without them. Scrolling down you will see images of our other datasets.  Coming down to the bottom of the page, you will see the interactive line chart and scatter plot.  Each one shows the summary of the points being shown when hovering the cursor over them, and then, like the pie chart at the top, you can eliminate different items (respectively, Model and Make for the first chart, and just Model for the second), showing how the chart looks without them.  Thus concludes the instructional manual.
